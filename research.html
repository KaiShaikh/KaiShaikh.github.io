  <div class="post-body">Project Description </div>
  <div class="info"> This summer, I, along with <a href = "http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~cjf151/">Colin Fan</a> and <a href = "http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~ss3664/">Saket Shah</a> will be
    working towards a proof of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenpreis_conjecture">Ehrenpreis Conjecture</a>
    for cusped surfaces, via a pants decomposition using degenerate pants. We are working under the mentorship of Professor <a href = "https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~alexk/">Alex Kontorovich</a>,
    and with the help of Professor <a href = "http://www.math.brown.edu/~kahn/">Jeremey Kahn</a>. To this end, we will first be attempting to produce
    &#91;using Python&#93; a pants decomposition of the standard fundamental domain for the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on the hyperbolic upper half-plane</div>
      </p>
  <hr>

  <div class="post-body"> <i>Week One</i> </div>
  <div class="info"> Learned basics of hyperbolic geometry and the general theory behind
    closed geodesics on the upper half plane modulo the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.</div>
      </p>
  <hr>

  <div class="post-body"> <i>Week Two</i> </div>
  <div class="info">Learned more about the correspondence between equivalence classes of quadratic forms and conjugacy classes of closed geodesics.
    We produced code that gives all closed geodesics of fixed length, using this correspodence. Still need to deal with some problems with efficiency of computation.</div>
      </p>
  <hr>

  <div class="post-body"> <i>Week Three</i> </div>
  <div class="info">Learned about the combinatorics of pants via "theta graphs" and the partitioning of cutting sequences. Using this reduction to a combinatorial problem,
    we were able to write code that produces all pants with cusps with length in a given range.</div>
      </p>
  <hr>

  <div class="post-body"> <i>Week Four</i> </div>
  <div class="info">We produced functions that get all the geodesics used in a list of pants, and, by producing cuspidal geodesics which approximate
  these closed ones, were able to produce a list of all eyes that can be derived from a given list of pants. We then converted our list of pants and eyes
  into a matrix telling us which pants contain which closed geodesics, and similarly for eyes; in producing this matrix, we selected one orientation of the closed geodesic
  to be positive (+1) and the other to be negative (-1); the semi-arbitrariness with which we chose which was positive and negative and potential issues with consistency
  may need to be resolved next week. </p>
<p>
  With respect to this matrix, a valid covering of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ corresponds an non-negative integer vector (non-zero) in the kernel of this matrix; furthermore, we would like a minimal such vector.
  By the end of the week(end), we had managed to implement a linear program using PuLP, which produces a solution minimal with respect to the $L^1$ norm. In order to
  produce a solution minimal in the $\ell^2$-norm (which is what we desire), we will have to use quadratic programming, hopefully at the beginning of next week.
</div>
      </p>
  <hr>

  <div class="post-body"> <i>Week Five</i> </div>
  <div class="info">At the beginning of this week we figured out how to plug our boundary matrix into a quadratic program to get a solution minimal in the $\ell^2$-norm.
  This way, we were able to minimize (roughly speaking) the variance in the pants&#8217; coefficients, in an attempt to produce a relatively uniform cover of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.
After this, we also had the chance to look at Professor Kahn&#8217;s code for producing quadratic forms and pants, and we ended up replacing our own functions that produce the
representatives of the narrow class group with the functions Professor Kahn had written for this purpose.</p>
<p>
Professor Kahn&#8217;s functions accomplish this goal much faster than our own,
due largely to a difference in strategy: where we computed the continued fraction corresponding to each quadratic form&#8217;s larger root and checked if we had seen one of its permutations already,
that is, if we already had a representative of that class, Professor Kahn started by producing the matrices corresponding to each form, and the matrices&#8217; "successors" a task computationally
roughly equivalent to computing the continued fraction of one element of the class. He then iterates over succesors until the starting matrix is returned to, and in this way produces a minimal representative
of each class while circumventing the redundant continued fraction calculations undertaken in our own code. </p>
<p>
We ended up keeping the section of our code that produces pairs of pants
from a given list of geodesics, because our methods were fairly similar to Professor Kahn&#8217;s, whence we believe that our code&#8217;s computational efficiency should be comparable as well.
</p> <p>
After integrating Professor Kahn&#8217;s code with our own, we were compute some more examples of covers of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ minimal in the $\ell^2$-norm. The variance in coefficients, however, remains somewhat higher than desired,
or expected, and we hope to work on understanding why this is the case and resolving this issue next week. With regards to the potential consistency issues relating to choice of orientation that I mentioned last week,
it turns out that no such issues arise, since we only actually care about making the number of pants on each side of a given geodesic equal.

  <div class="post-body"> <i>Week Six</i> </div>
  <div class="info"> This week we learned about shears, which essentially measure how different two compatible &#91;in the sense that they share a cuff&#93; pants are by
  lining up the pants in the upper half plane and constructing the semicircle orthogonal to a particular pair of geodesics within each pants. After doing this for two compatible pairs of pants, the shear between the two
is then given by the hyperbolic distance between the semicircles orthogonal to two corresponding closed geodeics in each pair of pants.</p> <p>
To approach this goal, we wrote a function that computes the hyperbolic distance between two semicirlces in the upper half plane, and another function that computes the semicircle orthogonal
to two given semicircles in the upper half plane &#91;and the x-axis&#93;. To compute the former, we were able to take advantage of inversive coordinates&#8217; nice parametrization of such semicircles,
and use the inner product with respect to the quadratic form $$Q = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}$$
After this we wrote a function to map pants into a standard position in the upper half plane, and then wrote a function to align two compatible pairs of pants so that $\gamma$ and $\gamma^{-1}$ coincide &#91;but with
opposite orientation, of course&#93; in the desired positions. This function seemed to work as desired in most cases, although there still appear to be some kinks that will need to be worked out.
</p><p>Here's an example of the function&#8217;s output &#91;which we&#8217;ve visualized using matplotlib&#93;:</p>
<p><img src="./images/pantsPutter.png" alt="Pants in the Upper Half-Plane" style="width:450px;height:250px;" class="center">
</p><p>
Here each pair of pants is represented by three semicircles, each of whose intersections with the x-axis are conjugate pairs of quadratic irrationals corresponding to
a representative of the equivalence class of the cutting sequence of the closed geodesic under the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.
 In the above visualization, each pair of pants has two smaller geodesics, which $"$flow$"$ to the right, and one larger geodesic
 which encapsulates the smaller two, and whose orientation is reversed with respect to the smaller two; that is, it flows to the left.
 Above, the first pair of pants is comprised of the geodesics marked with the brown, purple, and red arrows, while the second pair of
 pants corresponds to the closed geodesics marked with the orange, green, and blue arrows &#91;note: the blue arrow is behind the red arrow&#93;.
 Here, $\gamma$ and $\gamma^{-1}$ correspond to the semicircles marked with the red and blue arrows, respectively; note that blue&#8217;s orientation
 is opposite that of red.
